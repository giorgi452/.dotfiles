.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The configuration is divided into sections in an ini-like format. Every section
starts with the section's name in square brackets. After that is a list of
key-value pairs that specify the settings. Whitespace is purely cosmetic and
doesn't change the result.
.PP
The 'global' section contains the general settings applying to all of dunst. The
rest of the settings can be specified via rules and can be located in any
section. These rules can change a notification based on its properties. There
are filtering rules and modifying rules. Filtering rules specify what
notifications the rule applies to. Modifying rules specify changes
to the matching notifications. Some special sections have implied
filters that cannot be changed. For example, the "global" section has no
filters: it applies to all notifications.
.PP
See RULES for more details.
.PP
All experimental settings are marked with \fIExperimental\fR
.SS "Global section"
.IX Subsection "Global section"
.IP "\fBmonitor\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "monitor (default: 0)"
Specifies on which monitor the notifications should be displayed in, either by
name or by number, starting from 0. See the \fBfollow\fR setting.
.IP "\fBfollow\fR (values: [none/mouse/keyboard] default: none)" 4
.IX Item "follow (values: [none/mouse/keyboard] default: none)"
Defines where the notifications should be placed in a multi-monitor setup. All
values except \fInone\fR override the \fBmonitor\fR setting.
.Sp
On Wayland there is no difference between mouse and keyboard focus. When either
of them is used, the compositor will choose an output. This will generally be
the output last interacted with.
.RS 4
.IP \fBnone\fR 4
.IX Item "none"
The notifications will be placed on the monitor specified by the \fBmonitor\fR
setting.
.IP \fBmouse\fR 4
.IX Item "mouse"
The notifications will be placed on the monitor that the mouse is currently in.
.IP \fBkeyboard\fR 4
.IX Item "keyboard"
The notifications will be placed on the monitor that contains the window with
keyboard focus.

.IP "\fBenable_posix_regex\fR (default: false)" 4
.IX Item "enable_posix_regex (default: false)"
When set to true (recommended), you can use POSIX regular expressions for
filtering rules. It uses the POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax:
https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX\-Extended_Regular_Expressions.
.Sp
If this is set to false (not recommended), dunst will us \fBfnmatch\fR\|(3) for matching
strings. Dunst doesn't pass any flags to fnmatch, so you cannot make use of
extended patterns.
.Sp
The POSIX syntax is more powerful and will eventually become the default. The main
differences between POSIX and \fBfnmatch\fR\|(3) is that POSIX uses ".*" for wildcards
instead of "*" and POSIX allows for partial matches without needing wildcards.
This means that the pattern "abc" will match all strings that contain "abc",
like "abcdef".
.IP "\fBgeometry\fR DEPRECATED" 4
.IX Item "geometry DEPRECATED"
This setting is deprecated and removed. It's split up into \fBwidth\fR, \fBheight\fR, \fBorigin\fR,
\&\fBnotification_limit\fR and \fBoffset\fR.
For quickly transitioning to the new syntax, you can take the numbers from your
old geometry config as follows:
        geometry = <width>x<height>+<offset>
.Sp
In the new config you can then set the following variables (make sure to remove
any negative signs)
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    width = <width>
\&    height = <height>
\&    offset = <offset>
\&    origin = top\-right # or top\-left, or any other direction you prefer
.Ve
.IP \fBwidth\fR 4
.IX Item "width"
The width of the notification window in pixels. This can be a single number to
specify a constant width or two numbers for the minimum and maximum width. The
notification will expand from the minimum width as neccesary.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    width = 300      # constant width of 300
\&    width = (0, 300) # width between 0 and 300
.Ve
.Sp
When setting a width bigger than the screen, dunst will clamp the width to the
screen width. So if you want the notifcation to stretch the entire screen
dynamically, you may set the width to a high enough number, which none of your
screens exceed (e.g. 10000).
.IP \fBheight\fR 4
.IX Item "height"
The height of each notification in pixels. This can be a single number to
specify a constant height or two numbers for the minimum and maximum width. The
notification will expand from the minimum height as neccesary.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    height = 300      # constant height of 300
\&    height = (0, 300) # height between 0 and 300
.Ve
.Sp
Note that unlike width, different notifications can have diffrent height values.
.IP "\fBnotification_limit\fR (default: 20)" 4
.IX Item "notification_limit (default: 20)"
The number of notifications that can appear at one time. When this
limit is reached any additional notifications will be queued and displayed when
the currently displayed ones either time out or are manually dismissed. The
value 0 means no limit. If \fBindicate_hidden\fR is true, then the specified limit
is reduced by 1 and the last notification is a message informing how many hidden
notifications are waiting to be displayed. See the \fBindicate_hidden\fR entry for
more information.
.IP "\fBorigin\fR (default: top-right)" 4
.IX Item "origin (default: top-right)"
The origin of the notification window on the screen. It can then be moved with
offset.
Origin can be one of:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    top\-left
\&    top\-center
\&    top\-right
\&    bottom\-left
\&    bottom\-center
\&    bottom\-right
\&    left\-center
\&    center
\&    right\-center
.Ve
.IP "\fBoffset\fR format: (horizontal, vertical)" 4
.IX Item "offset format: (horizontal, vertical)"
Respectively the horizontal and vertical offset in pixels from the corner
of the screen specified by \fBorigin\fR. A negative offset will lead to the
notification being off screen.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    origin = top\-right
\&    offset = (10, 300) # a margin of 10 pixels from the right and 300 pixels from the top
.Ve
.Sp
For backwards compatibility the syntax NxN is also accepted.
.IP "\fBscale\fR (default: 0, X11 only)" 4
.IX Item "scale (default: 0, X11 only)"
Specifies a scale factor for dimensions to adapt notifications to
HiDPI screens. This scales the notification geometry and it's
contents. It is not recommended to use a fractional scaling factor, as
this may result in things being one pixel off. Try to use a whole
number scaling factor and adjust the font size and other sizes as
needed. If 0 is specified, the scale factor is auto-detected.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar\fR (values: [true/false], default: true)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar (values: [true/false], default: true)"
When an integer value is passed to dunst as a hint (see \fBNOTIFY-SEND\fR), a
progress bar will be drawn at the bottom of the notification. This
behavior can be turned off by setting this setting to false.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar_horizontal_alignment\fR (values: [left/center/right], default: center)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar_horizontal_alignment (values: [left/center/right], default: center)"
Horizontal alignment of the progress bar. The progress bar will always keep a
distance of \fBhorizontal_padding\fR from the edge of the notification.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar_height\fR (default: 10)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar_height (default: 10)"
The height of the progress bar in pixel. This includes the frame. Make sure
this value is bigger than twice the frame width.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar_min_width\fR (default: 150)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar_min_width (default: 150)"
The minimum width of the progress bar in pixels. The notification is rescaled
to fit the bar.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar_max_width\fR (default: 300)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar_max_width (default: 300)"
The maximum width of the progress bar in pixels. The notification is resized
to fit the progress bar.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar_frame_width\fR (default: 1)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar_frame_width (default: 1)"
The frame width of the progress bar in pixels. This value should be smaller
than half of the progress bar height.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar_corner_radius\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar_corner_radius (default: 0)"
The corner radius of the progress bar in pixels. Gives the progress bar
rounded corners. Set to 0 to disable.
.Sp
This setting will be ignored if \fBprogress_bar_corners\fR is set to none.
.IP "\fBprogress_bar_corners\fR (default: all)" 4
.IX Item "progress_bar_corners (default: all)"
Define which corners to round when drawing the progress bar. If progress_bar_corner_radius
is set to 0 this option will be ignored.
.Sp
See the \fBcorners\fR setting for the value format.
.IP "\fBicon_corner_radius\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "icon_corner_radius (default: 0)"
The corner radius of the icon image in pixels. Gives the icon
rounded corners. Set to 0 to disable.
.Sp
This setting will be ignored if \fBicon_corners\fR is set to none.
.IP "\fBicon_corners\fR (default: all)" 4
.IX Item "icon_corners (default: all)"
Define which corners to round when drawing the icon image. If icon_corner_radius
is set to 0 this option will be ignored.
.Sp
See the \fBcorners\fR setting for the value format.
.IP "\fBindicate_hidden\fR (values: [true/false], default: true)" 4
.IX Item "indicate_hidden (values: [true/false], default: true)"
If this is set to true, a notification indicating how many notifications are
not being displayed due to the notification limit (see \fBnotification_limit\fR)
will be shown \fBin place of the last notification slot\fR.
.Sp
Meaning that if this is enabled the number of visible notifications will be 1
less than what is specified by \fBnotification_limit\fR, the last slot will be
taken by the hidden count.
.IP "\fBtransparency\fR (default: 0) (X11 only)" 4
.IX Item "transparency (default: 0) (X11 only)"
A 0\-100 range on how transparent the notification window should be, with 0
being fully opaque and 100 invisible.
.Sp
This will affect the whole window. To make only parts of a window transparent
set the alpha channel in a color, see COLORS.
.Sp
To make windows transparent on wayland, set the transparent part of a color,
see COLORS.
.Sp
This setting will only work if a compositor is running.
.IP "\fBseparator_height\fR (default: 2)" 4
.IX Item "separator_height (default: 2)"
The height in pixels of the separator between notifications, if set to 0 there
will be no separating line between notifications. This setting will be ignored
if \fBgap_size\fR is greater than 0.
.IP "\fBpadding\fR (default: 8)" 4
.IX Item "padding (default: 8)"
The distance in pixels from the content to the separator/border of the window
in the vertical axis
.IP "\fBhorizontal_padding\fR (default: 8)" 4
.IX Item "horizontal_padding (default: 8)"
The distance in pixels from the content to the border of the window
in the horizontal axis
.IP "\fBtext_icon_padding\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "text_icon_padding (default: 0)"
The distance in pixels from the text to the icon (or vice versa)
in the horizontal axis.
.Sp
Setting this to a non-zero value overwrites any padding that horizontal_padding was adding between the notification text and icon.
.Sp
So for example setting
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    text_icon_padding=10
\&    horizontal_padding=10
.Ve
.Sp
is equivalent to
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    text_icon_padding=0
\&    horizontal_padding=10
.Ve
.IP "\fBframe_width\fR (default: 3)" 4
.IX Item "frame_width (default: 3)"
Defines width in pixels of frame around the notification window. Set to 0 to
disable.
.IP "\fBgap_size\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "gap_size (default: 0)"
Size of gap to display between notifications.
.Sp
If value is greater than 0, \fBseparator_height\fR will be ignored and a border
of size \fBframe_width\fR will be drawn around each notification instead.
.Sp
This setting requires a compositor and any applications displayed between the
gaps are not currently clickable.
.IP "\fBseparator_color\fR (values: [auto/foreground/frame/#RRGGBB] default: frame)" 4
.IX Item "separator_color (values: [auto/foreground/frame/#RRGGBB] default: frame)"
Sets the color of the separator line between two notifications.
.RS 4
.IP \fBauto\fR 4
.IX Item "auto"
Dunst tries to find a color that fits the rest of the notification color
scheme automatically.
.IP \fBforeground\fR 4
.IX Item "foreground"
The color will be set to the same as the foreground color of the topmost
notification that's being separated.
.IP \fBframe\fR 4
.IX Item "frame"
The color will be set to the frame color of the notification with the highest
urgency between the 2 notifications that are being separated.
.IP "\fBanything else\fR" 4
.IX Item "anything else"
Any other value is interpreted as a color, see COLORS
.RE

.IP "\fBsort\fR (values: [true/false/id/urgency_ascending/urgency_descending/update], default: true)" 4
.IX Item "sort (values: [true/false/id/urgency_ascending/urgency_descending/update], default: true)"
If set to true or urgency_descending, display notifications with higher urgency above the others.
critical first, then normal, then low.
.Sp
If set to false or id, sort notifications by id.
.Sp
If set to urgency_ascending, notifications are sorted by urgency,
low first, then normal, then critical.
.Sp
If set to update, notifications are sorted by their update_time.
So the most recent is always at the top. This means that if you set sort to update,
and stack_duplicates to true, the duplicate will always be at the top.
.Sp
When the notification window is at the bottom of the screen, this order is automatically reversed.
.IP "\fBidle_threshold\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "idle_threshold (default: 0)"
Don't timeout notifications if user is idle longer than this time.
See TIME FORMAT for valid times.
.Sp
Set to 0 to disable.
.Sp
A client can mark a notification as transient to bypass this setting and timeout
anyway. Use a rule with 'set_transient = no' to disable this behavior.
.Sp
Note: this doesn't work on xwayland.
.IP "\fBlayer\fR (Wayland only)" 4
.IX Item "layer (Wayland only)"
One of bottom, top or overlay.
.Sp
Place dunst notifications on the selected layer. Using overlay
will cause notifications to be displayed above fullscreen windows, though
this may also occur at top depending on your compositor.
.Sp
The bottom layer is below all windows and above the background.
.Sp
Default: overlay
.IP "\fBforce_xwayland\fR (values: [true/false], default: false) (Wayland only)" 4
.IX Item "force_xwayland (values: [true/false], default: false) (Wayland only)"
Force the use of X11 output, even on a wayland compositor. This setting
has no effect when not using a Wayland compositor.
.Sp
This setting will be ignored if dunst was compiled without X11 support.
.IP "\fBfont\fR (default: ""Monospace 8"")" 4
.IX Item "font (default: ""Monospace 8"")"
Defines the font or font set used. Optionally set the size as a decimal number
after the font name and space.
Multiple font options can be separated with commas.
.Sp
This options is parsed as a Pango font description.
.IP "\fBline_height\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "line_height (default: 0)"
The amount of extra spacing between text lines in pixels. Set to 0 to
disable.
.IP "\fBformat\fR (default: ""<b>%s</b>\en%b"")" 4
.IX Item "format (default: ""<b>%s</b>n%b"")"
Specifies how the various attributes of the notification should be formatted on
the notification window.
.Sp
Regardless of the status of the \fBmarkup\fR setting, any markup tags that are
present in the format will be parsed. Note that because of that, if a literal
ampersand (&) is needed it needs to be escaped as '&amp;'
.Sp
If '\en' is present anywhere in the format, it will be replaced with
a literal newline.
.Sp
If any of the following strings are present, they will be replaced with the
equivalent notification attribute.
.Sp

.IP "\fBicon_path\fR (default: ""/usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/status/:/usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/devices/"")" 4
.IX Item "icon_path (default: ""/usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/status/:/usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/devices/"")"
Can be set to a colon-separated list of paths to search for icons to use with
notifications.
.Sp
Dunst doens't search outside of these direcories. For a recursive icon lookup
system, see \fBenable_recursive_icon_lookup\fR. This new system will eventually
replace this and will need new settings.
.IP "\fBicon_theme\fR (default: ""Adwaita"", example: ""Adwaita, breeze"")" 4
.IX Item "icon_theme (default: ""Adwaita"", example: ""Adwaita, breeze"")"
Comma-separated list of names of the the themes to use for looking up icons. This
as to be the name of the directory in which the theme is located, not the
human-friendly name of the theme. So for example, the theme \fBBreeze Dark\fR is
located in \fI/usr/share/icons/breeze\-dark\fR. In this case you have to set the
theme to \fBbreeze-dark\fR.
.Sp
The first theme in the list is the most important. Only if the icon cannot be
found in that theme, the next theme will be tried.
.Sp
Dunst will look for the themes in \fBXDG_DATA_HOME/icons\fR and
\&\fR\f(CB$XDG_DATA_DIRS\fR\fB/icons\fR as specified in the icon theme specification:
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon\-theme\-spec/icon\-theme\-spec\-latest.html.
.Sp
If the theme inherits from other themes, they will be used as a backup.
.Sp
This setting is experimental and not enabled by default. See
\&\fBenable_recursive_icon_lookup\fR for how to enable it.
.IP "\fBenable_recursive_icon_lookup\fR (default: false)" 4
.IX Item "enable_recursive_icon_lookup (default: false)"
This setting enables the new icon lookup method. This new system will eventually
be the old icon lookup.
.Sp
Currently icons are looked up in the \fBicon_path\fR. Since the \fBicon_path\fR wasn't
recursive, one had to add a ton of paths to this list.
This has been drastically simplified by the new lookup method. Now you only have
to set \fBicon_theme\fR to the name of the theme you want. To enable this new
behaviour, set \fBenable_recursive_icon_lookup\fR to true in the \fI[global]\fR
section. See the respective settings for more details.
.IP "\fBsticky_history\fR (values: [true/false], default: true)" 4
.IX Item "sticky_history (values: [true/false], default: true)"
If set to true, notifications that have been recalled from history will not
time out automatically.
.IP "\fBhistory_length\fR (default: 20)" 4

HISTORY.
.IP "\fBdmenu\fR (default: ""/usr/bin/dmenu \-p dunst"")" 4
.IX Item "dmenu (default: ""/usr/bin/dmenu -p dunst"")"

a dmenu command or a dmenu-compatible menu.
.IP "\fBbrowser\fR (default: ""/usr/bin/xdg\-open"")" 4
.IX Item "browser (default: ""/usr/bin/xdg-open"")"

.IP "\fBtitle\fR (default: ""Dunst"") (X11 only)" 4
.IX Item "title (default: ""Dunst"") (X11 only)"
Defines the title of notification windows spawned by dunst. (_NET_WM_NAME
property). There should be no need to modify this setting for regular use.
.IP "\fBclass\fR (default: ""Dunst"") (X11 only)" 4
.IX Item "class (default: ""Dunst"") (X11 only)"

.IP "\fBforce_xinerama\fR (values: [true/false], default: false) (X11 only)" 4
.IX Item "force_xinerama (values: [true/false], default: false) (X11 only)"
Use the Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support. This
setting is provided for compatibility with older nVidia drivers that do not
support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly discouraged.
.Sp
By enabling this setting dunst will not be able to detect when a monitor is
connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen layout
changes.
.IP "\fBcorner_radius\fR (default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "corner_radius (default: 0)"
Define the corner radius in pixels. A corner radius of 0 will result in
rectangular shaped notifications.
.Sp
By enabling this setting the outer border and the frame will be shaped.

.IP "\fBoverride_pause_level\fR (values: [0\-100], default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "override_pause_level (values: [0-100], default: 0)"
A Notification will appear whenever notification's
override_pause_level >= dunst's paused level. Setting this to values other than 0
allows you to create partial pause modes, where more urgent notifications get through,
but less urgent stay paused. For example, when you can set a low battery noficiation's
override_pause_level to 60 and then set dunst's pause level to 60. This will cause dunst to
only show battery level notification (and other notifications with override_pause_level >= 60),
while suspending others.
.SS "Keyboard shortcuts (X11 only)"
.IX Subsection "Keyboard shortcuts (X11 only)"
Keyboard shortcuts are defined in the following format: "Modifier+key" where the

.PP
Note that the keyboard shortcuts have been moved to the \fBglobal\fR section of the

The urgency sections work in a similar way to rules and can be used to specify
attributes for the different urgency levels of notifications (low, normal,
critical). Currently only the background, foreground, hightlight, timeout,
frame_color and icon attributes can be modified.
.PP
The urgency sections are urgency_low, urgency_normal, urgency_critical for low,
normal and critical urgency respectively.

.SH DUNSTCTL
.IX Header "DUNSTCTL"
Dunst now contains a command line control command that can be used to interact
with it. It supports all functions previously done only via keyboard shortcuts
but also has a lot of extra functionality. For more information, see
\&\fBdunstctl\fR\|(1).
.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
Dunst saves a number of notifications (specified by \fBhistory_length\fR) in memory.
These notifications can be recalled (i.e. redisplayed) by calling
\&\fBdunstctl history\fR (see \fBdunstctl\fR\|(1)). Whether these notifications will time out
like if they have been just send depends on the value of the \fBsticky_history\fR
setting. Actions are invalidated once the notification is closed, so you cannot
execute that action when you bring back a notification from history.
.PP
Past notifications are redisplayed in a first-in-last-out order, meaning that
pressing the history key once will bring up the most recent notification that
had been closed/timed out.
.SH WAYLAND
.IX Header "WAYLAND"
Dunst has Wayland support since version 1.6.0. Because the Wayland protocol
is more focused on security, some things that are possible in X11 are not
possible in Wayland. Those differences are reflected in the configuration.
The main things that change are that dunst on Wayland cannot use global
hotkeys (they are deprecated anyways, use dunstctl).
.PP
Some dunst features on wayland might need your compositor to support a certain
protocol. Dunst will warn you if an optional feature isn't supported and will
disable the corresponding functionality.
.PP
Fullscreen detection works on wayland with some limitations (see \fBfullscreen\fR).
If you want notifications to appear over fullscreen windows, set
\&\fBlayer = overlay\fR in the global options.
.PP
Note that the same limitations exist when using xwayland.
If something doesn't quite work in Wayland, please file a bug report. In the
mean time, you can try if the X11 output does work on wayland. Use
\&\fBforce_xwayland = true\fR for that.
.PP
If you have your dunst notifications on the same side of your display as your
status bar, you might notice that your notifications appear a bit higher or
lower than on X11. This is because the notification cannot be placed on top of
your status bar. The notifications are placed relative to your status bar,
making them appear higher or lower by the height of your status bar. We cannot
do anything about that behavior.
.PP
Note that dunst creates a "desktop layer" using the layer shell protocol and not
a regular Wayland window. This has some limitations like stated above.
For example you can't set a window title/class.
.SH RULES
.IX Header "RULES"
Rules allow the conditional modification of notifications. They can be located
in a section with any name, even the special sections. The special sections do
not allow filters to be added, since they have implied filters by default.
.IP 'global' 4
.IX Item "'global'"
No filters, matches all notifications.
.IP "'urgency_low', 'urgency_normal' and 'urgency_critical'" 4
.IX Item "'urgency_low', 'urgency_normal' and 'urgency_critical'"
Matches low, normal or critical urgency respectively.
.PP
There are 2 parts in configuring a rule: Defining the filters that controls when
a rule should apply and then the actions that should be taken when the rule is
matched. It's also possible to not specify any filters, in which case the rule
will match all notifications.
.PP
Rules are applied in order of appearance. Beware: if a notification is changed by a
rule, it may affect if it's being matched by a later rule.
.IP \fBfiltering\fR 4
.IX Item "filtering"
With filtering rules you can match notifications to apply rules to only a subset
of notifications.
.Sp
For filtering rules that filter based on strings you can use regular
expressions. It's recommended to set \fBenable_posix_regex\fR to true. You can then
use the POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax:
https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX\-Extended_Regular_Expressions.
.Sp
Notifications can be matched for any of the following attributes.
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """appname"" (discouraged, see desktop_entry)" 4

.Sp
To define a matching rule simply assign the specified value to the value that
should be matched, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    appname="notify\-send"
.Ve
.Sp
Matches only messages that were send via notify-send. If multiple filter
expressions are present, all of them have to match for the rule to be applied
(logical AND).
.Sp
Shell-like globbing is supported.

.IX Item "modifying"
The following attributes can be overridden:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """background""" 4

.ie n .IP """fullscreen""" 4
.el .IP \f(CWfullscreen\fR 4
.IX Item "fullscreen"
One of show, delay, or pushback.
.Sp
This attribute specifies how notifications are handled if a fullscreen window
is focused. By default it's set to show so notifications are being shown.
.Sp
Other possible values are delay: Already shown notifications are continued to be
displayed until they are dismissed or time out but new notifications will be
held back and displayed when the focus to the fullscreen window is lost.
.Sp
Or pushback which is equivalent to delay with the difference that already
existing notifications are paused and hidden until the focus to the fullscreen
window is lost.
.Sp
On wayland, if \fBfollow\fR is set to mouse or keyboard, the output where the
notification is located cannot be determined. So dunst will delay or pushback if
any of the outputs is fullscreen. Since the fullscreen protocol is fairly new,
you will need a recent version of a compositor that supports it. At the time of
writing, you will need the git version of sway.
See also \fBlayer\fR to change if notifications appear above fullscreen windows in
Wayland.
.Sp
Default: show
.IP "\fBmin_icon_size\fR (default: 32)" 4
.IX Item "min_icon_size (default: 32)"
Defines the minimum size in pixels for the icons.
If the icon is larger than or equal to the specified value it won't be affected.
If it's smaller then it will be scaled up so that the smaller axis is equivalent
to the specified size.
.Sp
When using recursive icon lookup (see \fBenable_recursive_icon_lookup\fR), all
icons from a theme will be this size.

Within rules you can specify a script to be run every time the rule is matched
by assigning the 'script' option to the name of the script to be run.
.PP
When the script is called details of the notification that triggered it will be
passed via environment variables. The following variables are available:
\&\fBDUNST_APP_NAME\fR, \fBDUNST_SUMMARY\fR, \fBDUNST_BODY\fR, \fBDUNST_ICON_PATH\fR,
\&\fBDUNST_URGENCY\fR, \fBDUNST_ID\fR, \fBDUNST_PROGRESS\fR, \fBDUNST_CATEGORY\fR,

\&\fBDUNST_DESKTOP_ENTRY\fR, and \fBDUNST_STACK_TAG\fR.
.PP
Another, less recommended way to get notifcations details from a script is via
command line parameters. These are passed to the script in the following order:
\&\fBappname\fR, \fBsummary\fR, \fBbody\fR, \fBicon_path\fR, \fBurgency\fR.
.PP
Where \fBDUNST_ICON_PATH\fR or \fBicon_path\fR is the absolute path to the icon file
if there is one. \fBDUNST_URGENCY\fR or \fBurgency\fR is one of "LOW", "NORMAL" or
"CRITICAL". \fBDUNST_URLS\fR is a newline-separated list of urls associated with
the notification.

interacting with these actions.
.PP
If "show_indicators" is true and a notification has an action, an "(A)" will be
prepended to the notification format. Likewise, an "(U)" is prepended to
notifications with URLs. It is possible to interact with notifications that
have actions regardless of this setting, though it may not be obvious which
notifications HAVE actions.
.PP
The "context" keybinding is used to interact with these actions, by showing a
menu of possible actions. This feature requires "dmenu" or a dmenu drop-in
replacement present.
.PP
Alternatively, you can invoke an action with a middle click on the notification.
If there is exactly one associated action, or one is marked as default, that one
is invoked. If there are multiple, the context menu is shown. The same applies
to URLs when there are no actions.
.SH "TIME FORMAT"
.IX Header "TIME FORMAT"
A time can be any decimal integer value suffixed with a time unit. If no unit
given, seconds ("s") is taken as default.
.PP
Time units understood by dunst are "ms", "s", "m", "h" and "d".
.PP
Example time: "1000ms" "10m"
